# Code Mate

## A real time code collaboration web app

This app allows two users to connect and edit code in real time. It also allows them to chat and dicusss possible solutions to a coding problem.

### Inspiration

The process of trying to help my peers debug their coding assignments remotely (through Groupme) is slow and inefficient. This web app is intended to improve that proces.

#### This app is still in development process
